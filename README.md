# IISD-Lakes Project

## Background
Partner with the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD)-Experimental Lakes Area to address climate change impact on freshwater lakes in Canada by analyzing the effect that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) has on species that live in the lakes.

## Deliverables
Phase 1:
a. Exploratory analysis of species data
b. Identify potential machine learning/deep learning solution
c. Develop open-source API to make findings accessible & reproducible
Preliminary Question we are trying to answer:
Do certain phytoplankton species group together (e.g. when one species increases or decreases in population, does another species also change accordingly?) 
If so, can these species grouping be explained by season (i.e. month) or water chemistry variables (e.g. Dissolved Organic Carbon)?


## Data
We have .csv files from IISD stored on a dedicated Google Drive folder.
